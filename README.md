# React-Application

You can use the create-react-app tool which provides a modern build setup allowing you to quickly create and run React applications with minimal configuration. The create-react-app is a command-line interface (CLI).

To install create-react-app, follow the below steps:

1. Install node.js with version 14+ from Node.js official site or from Software House

You can check the node version installed in your machine by running the following command which displays the node version as follows:

# node -v
v17.2.0

Note: Installing the node modules is prevented if the system is connected to the Infosys network. To bypass that set the below proxy by typing the below-mentioned code in the node.js command prompt. 

# npm config set registry https://infyartifactory.ad.infosys.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm

2. Install create-react-app by running the following command:

# npm install -g create-react-app

3. Once the installation is done, create a React app using the below command:

# create-react-app my-app

4. To run the application, navigate to the folder my-app and run the command as shown below:

# my-app>npm start
